# Jive 
- The demo shows the most recent updates to the codebase. This is a side project that is still being built.
- My main goal with this is to turn my audiobooks into `.epubs`/ebooks that I can read using this web app and map my audiobooks to my ebooks. Similar to how fancy video web players show you a live transcript with anchors to the video. I want the audiobook player to have an ebook view that turns the pages as it plays the audiobook.
